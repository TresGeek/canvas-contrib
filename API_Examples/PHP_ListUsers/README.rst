PHP Fetch Current Final Grades 
===============================

This script demonstrates a simple fetching of course grades for a Canvas course.  The
script is written in PHP.  pagination.php contains library functions used by
ViewResults.php.

Support
========

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in 
mind. Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this.
That said, the community will hopefully help support and keep
both the script and this documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
