Add Delete Button to Course List (Admin) - JavaScript and CSS
======

When viewing the list of courses in the Canvas Admin, quicklinks appear as you mouseover
each course.  These quicklinks include 'Settings', 'Statistics', and 'Homepage'.  This
javascript will add 'delete' to this list.  When learning canvas, and specifically when
working in a sandbox environment, it can be useful to be able to quickly delete a course
without having to visit the course homepage or the settings page.  

Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in 
mind. Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this.
That said, the community will hopefully help support and keep
both the script and this documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
