Windows-based SIS Integration Examples
======

This folder includes examples of code that can be used to integrate
SIS systems with Canvas. These are relatively simple but can serve
as a framework on which you can build.

As always, this is provided AS-IS, without warranty, and without any
support beyond this document and anyone kind enough to help from the
community.

Support
======

This is an unsupported, community-created project. Keep that in 
mind. Instructure won't be able to help you fix or debug this.
That said, the community will hopefully help support and keep
both the script and this documentation up-to-date.

Good luck!
